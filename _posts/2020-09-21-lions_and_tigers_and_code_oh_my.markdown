The world of programming long felt like a fantastically frightful forest. Thick with arduous terrain and impossible challenges for someone like me-and only those perfectly equipped with experience from years of being in tech, or raised in it, are capable of succeeding. It wasn't until recently, did I learn this to be untrue. My perspective on software engineering and the world it resides in was completely wrong. I've learned that the world of programming has within it an endless cycle of learning, designing, and evolving. And that's fascinating to me.

It's much more fascinating than I led myself to believe growing up. I find the opportunity of learning software development now and potentially aiding in it's growth and development to be exhilarating. Technology itself has evolved exponentially over the last 10 years, and it won't be stopping any time soon. With technology's regular leaps in development, there will always be new problems to solve and new ventures to explore. It's in this opportunity to learn new skills and explore that I find myself finally taking steps toward a career change. 

For the last 8 years, I've taught theory to college students at several institutions. Because I've always planned my curriculm around career development and personal improvement, this means for the last 8 years, I have also witnessed my students discover, pursue, and succeed in their aspired careers. My goal for completing this program is to do as I've seen my students do, and foster this budding interest I have in this incredibly fascinating world of programming.

By no means do I expect this to be an easy stroll down yellow brick road. Instead, I expect several challenges that I'll struggle with and have to overcome. No journey's are worth taking, afterall, without the occasional lion, tiger, or bear.
